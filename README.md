Overview
========

Docker image for Openhab (1.6.1).

Forked from tdeckers/docker-openhab

Updated to use hypriot/rpi-java as the base image for the raspberry pi.

Building
========

```docker build -t <username>/openhab```

Running
=======

* The image exposes Openhab ports 8080, 8443, 5555 and 9001 (supervisord).
* It expects you to make a configurations directory on the host to /opt/openhab/configurations.  This allows you to inject your openhab configuration into the container (see example below).
* To enable specific plugins, add a file with name addons.cfg in the configuration directory which lists all addons you want to add.

Example content for addons.cfg:
```
org.openhab.action.mail-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.action.squeezebox-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.action.xmpp-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.binding.exec-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.binding.http-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.binding.knx-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.binding.mqtt-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.binding.networkhealth-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.binding.serial-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.binding.squeezebox-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.io.squeezeserver-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.persistence.cosm-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.persistence.db4o-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.persistence.gcal-1.6.1.jar
org.openhab.persistence.rrd4j-1.6.1.jar
```

* The openhab process is managed using supervisord.  You can manage the process (and view logs) by exposing port 9001.
* The container supports starting without network (--net="none"), and adding network interfaces using pipework.
* You can add a timezone file in the configurations directory, which will be placed in /etc/timezone.

Example content for timezone:
```
Europe/Brussels
```

Example run command:
```docker -d -p 8080:8080 -v /tmp/configuration:/opt/openhab/configurations tdeckers/openhab```

MyOpenhab
=========
This container includes the myopenhab addon (org.openhab.io.myopenhab-1.4.0-SNAPSHOT.jar). See https://my.openhab.org/docs.

To obtain the uuid and secret files, you first have to start openhab with myopenhab enabled. After that you can view the content of the file in the container with the command:
```
$ sudo cat /var/lib/docker/aufs/mnt/`sudo docker inspect -f '{{.Id}}' CONTAINER_SHORT_NAME`/opt/openhab/webapps/static/{uuid,secret}
```
